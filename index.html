        <img src="https://mcreator.net/sites/default/files/2020-12/2020-11-26_21.33.58%20%281%29.png"width=600px/>
                <h3>«Caves & Cliffs»: Part 2 — the second part of the renovation of the cave and the cliff. In it, the generation of the upper world, mountains and caves has been completely updated. Added new biomes, music and achievements.

    List of changes:
    ● Generation changes:
    ● A new way of generating caves - "Noisy" caves.
    - There are 3 types of "noisy" generation:
    • "Cheese" caves. They look like huge holes in cheese. Forms caves of various sizes.
    • Caves "Spaghetti". They look like long winding tunnels.
    • Caves "Noodles". A thinner and more wavy version of the "spaghetti" caves.
    - Can reach enormous sizes.
    - Old caves and canyons are still being generated.
    - “Noisy” caves also form entrances.
    - Added aquifers. These are local water levels ("lakes"). They are generated in caves, mountains and sometimes on the surface.
    - Less than zero height, lava beds are formed.
    - Added "Deep crevices".
    - Blocks of magma sometimes form at the bottom of underground water bodies.
    - Removed underwater caves and canyons as aquifers play their role.
    - Starting from zero height and below, the stone is replaced with deep slate.
    - Underground structures, dungeons and caves now generate up to -64 heights.
    - Granite, diorite, andesite and mud are not found below -64 heights.
    - The size of granite, diorite and andesite deposits has been changed.
    - Dropper Clusters no longer appear in normal caves. Only in Karst.
    - Deep shale deposits are no longer generated above zero elevation.
    - Above the 60th height, there are fewer deposits of granite, diorite and andesite.
    - Bone remains below zero height contain deep diamond ore instead of coal.
    - Increased the number of rooms with spawners, especially below height 0.

    ● Removed world types "Caves" and "Flying Islands".

    ● Added ore veins.
    Click to take a look
    - Large, rare clumps of ore, similar to a ball of snakes.
    - Copper veins mixed with granite are generated from 0 to 50 heights.
    - Iron veins, mixed with tuff, generate from -60 to -8 heights.

    ● The height of the world has been increased. Now its maximum value is 320 blocks.

    ● Mixing old and new generation:
    - When opening the old world on version 1.18, generation joints will be automatically smoothed.
    - When mixing, the bedrock will be replaced by deep shale and up to -64 height a new generation is formed with a new bedrock layer.

    ● New biomes:
    ● Added new mountain biomes.
    - "Grove"
    • It is a snowy spruce forest with loose snow traps.
    • Generated on mountain slopes.
    • The biome is home to wolves, foxes and rabbits.
    - "Sublime Mountain Peaks"
    • Jagged mountain peaks. They look like a stone covered with snow.
    • The biome is inhabited by goats.
    - "Meadow"
    • Large grassy and floral biome. It is generated high on a plateau or near large mountain ranges.
    • A lone oak or birch can be found in the biome, often with a bee's nest.
    • The biome is home to donkeys, rabbits and sheep.
    - "Snow-capped peaks"
    • Smooth mountain peaks with ice and snow.
    • The biome is inhabited by goats.
    - "Snowy slopes"
    • Contains a lot of loose snow.
    • Generated in highlands under mountain peaks or on hilltops.
    • Inhabited by rabbits and goats.
    - "Stone Peaks"
    • May be jagged and flat.
    • Calcite bands are sometimes generated in the biome.
    • Goats live.

    ● Karst caves:
    - A large number of ceiling and floor drips are generated.
    - Small bodies of water are generated.
    - Sometimes you can find huge stalactites and stalagmites made from drip stones.
    - Copper ore is more common in karst caves.

    ● Lush caves:
    - The floor and ceiling of the caves are covered with moss.
    - Spore flowers grow on the ceiling.
    - Clay pools with tosses are generated.
    - Azalea bushes and their blooming variations are generated.
    - Azalea trees run down to lush caves, making it easy to find the biome.

    ● Updated ore generation.
    - Now matches the new height, and adds more strategy to loot.
    - Iron ore is formed below the 72nd height to the 16th - the deeper, the more often. Also generated above 112 - the higher, the more often.
    - Copper ore is generated in the range from 0 to 95th height - the closer to the 48th height, the more often.
    - Lapis lazuli is generated from height 64 to 0 - the deeper, the more often. Below -32th or above 32nd height is covered by other blocks or is under water.
    - Coal is from 0 to 96th height - the higher, the more often. In caves, it is covered with stone or under water.
    - Gold is from 32th to -16th height - the deeper, the more often.
    - Redstone is formed below the 16th height - the lower the -32th height, the more often.
